                                We went to the top of it, and we came back down to enjoy Cheesecake Factory. A pain had been 
                                developing in the left side of my chest, and by the time we sat down to eat, it had grown unbearable.
                                I told her I needed to go to the hopsital, and we elected to walk to the nearest one, a childrens hopsital.
                                There, we found out I had a minor collapsed lung, or pneumothorax.

                                On July 2nd, we went to the mall and had a great time, especially at a Lego store and Nike store.
                                Afterwards, we went to a nearby park, and that's where we decided to make it offical! It was 
                                such an unbelievable moment, and it took me months to sink in that a girl like her was my girlfriend.

                                to take a Greyhound bus back to Georgia. The passenger next to me ended up just laying down 
                                next to me in the seat üò≠üôèüèæ. The bus ended up breaking down in Indiana for 3 hours and we missed 
                                our connecting bus in Louisville, so they just dumped us off there at 2 AM. Thankfully there 
                                were family friends that I stayed with until my parents came to pick me up.

                                for the internship that I'm doing right now as I build this website. She was definitely my lucky charm,
                                as out of 8 places I interviewed for, this was my only offer! I'm sure she'll get revenge on me for

                                After our longest time apart ever, I finally made it back to Chicago after what felt like forever.
                                On February 17th, we went shopping and I was absolutely FREEZING in the Brandy Melville line. Thankfully,
                                she showed me mercy and we went to Macy's. Inside, she fell in love with Creed Aventus and really wanted
                                me to get it... and then I told her the price.

                                After we survived her driving, she got to meet my parents! I took her on a tour of Augusta and 
                                all the important spots of my childhood, which was really special to me. We then met my best friend
                                Shivum and his girlfriend Shreya, and of course both of them (Nethra and Shreya) were forced to 
                                third wheel for a while. Finally, we (me and Nethra this time) made our own little mark in history
                                by putting a lock on the Augusta Canal with our initials. This has been a tradition in Augusta since
                                the 1800's and it felt like I had gone through a rite of passage unique to my childhood community.

                                That next morning, in a bid to impress Nethra with her nutritious cooking, my mom decided to make us
                                both healthy smoothies. Unbeknownst to me, she also included tree nuts in them! (My mom has always
                                chosen to not believe in my allergies). At the same time, I was already having chest pain due to 
                                my pollen allergies. So while dropping Nethra off to the airport, the pain became unbearable and we
                                had to drive to the ER. There, my chest pain was taken care of and the nut allergies kicked in!
                                My entire body was covered in hives and my mom cried a lot but I turned out fine. My dad drove us 
                                to the airport and Nethra took care of me in the back with so much love :)
